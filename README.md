# Two In One Calculator üî¢

A **Two In One Calculator** app built with **Jetpack Compose** and **Kotlin** that offers both a **basic calculator** for everyday use and a **scientific calculator** for more advanced calculations. The app is designed for quick, intuitive, and efficient calculations.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Basic Calculator**: Perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Scientific Calculator**: Advanced functions like trigonometry, logarithms, exponents, and more.
- **Switch between Modes**: Easily toggle between basic and scientific modes.
- **Clear and Responsive UI**: A smooth and intuitive interface built using Jetpack Compose.
- **Memory Functions**: Save and recall previous calculations for both basic and scientific operations.

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

- **Kotlin** - Programming language used for Android development.
- **Jetpack Compose** - Modern Android UI toolkit for creating responsive and declarative UI.

## Architecture üèõÔ∏è

The app follows an **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture to maintain a clean separation between UI and business logic:
- **Model**: Contains the logic for calculations.
- **ViewModel**: Manages and stores UI-related data and communicates with the Model.
- **View**: Jetpack Compose UI that updates reactively based on data from the ViewModel.
